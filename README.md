# Robotics Team Charlie
ROS code to run our autonomous ground robot for Fundamentals of Robotics 2016

## Setup
1. Follow the ROS setup tutorials
2. Navigate to your `catkin_ws/src` (`cd ~/catkin_ws/src`)
3. Clone  this repository (`git clone git@github.com:ManickYoj/RoboTeamCharlie.git`)

## Git Guidelines
Never push directly to master (in fact, you won't be able to). Instead:

1. Create a branch for your features (`git checkout -b <branchname>`)
2. Push to the corresponding branch on Github (`git push origin <branchname>`)
3. If you would like your code to be merged into master (ie. you are done with your feature), submit a pull request on Github

Currently shows the fore-brain setup, but mid and hind-brain have yet to be added.
